	Abstract = {{The early science results from the new generation of high-resolution
stellar spectroscopic surveys, such as Galactic Archaeology with HERMES
(GALAH) and the Gaia European Southern Observatory survey (Gaia-ESO),
will represent major milestones in the quest to chemically tag the
Galaxy. Yet this technique to reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar
groups has remained largely untested until recently. We build on
previous work that developed an empirical chemical tagging probability
function, which describes the likelihood that two field stars are
conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment. In
this work, we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment,
i.e. tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernible associations,
on a sample of 714 disc field stars with a number of high-quality
high-resolution homogeneous metal abundance measurements. We present
evidence that chemical tagging of field stars does identify coeval
groups of stars, yet these groups may not represent distinct formation
sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters, as previously thought. Our
results point to several important conclusions, among them that group
finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundance space, e.g.
stellar ages, kinematics, colours, temperature and surface gravity do
not enhance the detectability of groups. We also demonstrate that in
addition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic
history of the Galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new
stellar age determination technique.

	Abstract = {{The first generation of large-scale chemical tagging surveys, in
particular the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph
(HERMES)/Galactic Archaeology with HERMES million star survey, promises
to vastly expand our understanding of the chemical and dynamical
evolution of the Galaxy. This, however, is contingent on our ability to
confidently perform chemical tagging on such a large data set. Chemical
homogeneity has been observed across a range of elements within several
Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this is the case
globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across clusters
themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval
cluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are
rooted in the evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages,
of early generations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such
stages are not yet sufficient to explain all observations, combining
with our significant gaps in the understanding of star formation, makes
this a difficult arena to tackle theoretically. Here, we describe a
robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the chemical difference between
two stellar components. This metric is then applied to a data base of
high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a function
describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary
origin. With this cluster probability function, it will be possible to
report a confidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with
which clusters are detected, independent of the group finding methods.
This formulation is also used to probe the role of chemical
dimensionality, and that of individual chemical species, on the ability
of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval groups of stars.

dispersion as a function of the Galactic height for a sample drawn from
a realistic Galaxy distribution function by following the method
presented by Moni Bidin, Carraro {\amp} Mendez. We find that, for the
sample size used, the observational error in the velocities is much
smaller than the Poisson noise which has not been accounted for by Moni
Bidin et al. We repeat the analysis on a large number of samples to
estimate the contribution of the Poisson noise and to uncover any
systematics. We find that the dispersion is systematically overestimated
at low Galactic heights and slightly underestimated at high Galactic
heights, leading to an underestimate of the gradient of the dispersion
with Galactic height. The causes of the systematics are revealed by
repeating the calculation using a method inspired by Girard et al. This
method recovers the expected dispersion much more successfully and in
particular yields a gradient of the dispersion with Galactic height
which is approximately three times that found using the method presented
by Moni Bidin et al.

which it has a resonant origin, for regions of the Galaxy beyond the
solar neighbourhood. We show that while models associated with different
resonances can produce nearly identical substructure in the local
velocity distribution, the velocity distribution away from the solar
neighbourhood has different properties for different models. In
particular, there is a variation between different models of where in
Galactocentric radius the observed Hyades signal in velocity space is
strongest, at a given Galactic azimuth. We note, however, that the
uncertainties in currently available data, primarily due to uncertain
distances to stars, hide these signatures rather effectively, meaning we
are not yet able to determine which resonance is the cause of the
Hyades.

	Abstract = {{We introduce a method for measuring the slopes of mass profiles within
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies directly from stellar spectroscopic
data and without adopting a dark matter halo model. Our method combines
two recent results: (1) spherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models
imply that the product of half-light radius and (squared) stellar
velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within the
half-light radius of a dSph stellar component, and (2) some dSphs have
chemodynamically distinct stellar subcomponents that independently trace
the same gravitational potential. We devise a statistical method that
uses measurements of stellar positions, velocities, and spectral indices
to distinguish two dSph stellar subcomponents and to estimate their
individual half-light radii and velocity dispersions. For a dSph with
two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain estimates of masses
enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile, immediately
defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our method
distinguishes stellar subcomponents in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs,
for which we measure slopes {$\Gamma$} {\equiv} {$\Delta$}log M/{$\Delta$}log r =
2.61$^{+0.43}$ $_{-0.37}$ and {$\Gamma$} = 2.95$^{+0.51}$
$_{-0.39}$, respectively. These values are consistent with ''cores''
of constant density within the central few hundred parsecs of each
galaxy and rule out ''cuspy'' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles (dlog
M/dlog r {\lt}= 2 at all radii) with a significance {\gt}\~{} 96\% and {\gt}\~{}
99\%, respectively. Tests with synthetic data indicate that our method
tends systematically to overestimate the mass of the inner stellar
subcomponent to a greater degree than that of the outer stellar
subcomponent, and therefore to underestimate the slope {$\Gamma$} (implying
that the stated NFW exclusion levels are conservative).

that much of the halo is made up of cannibalized satellite galaxies, and
that dark matter is distributed nearly spherically in the Milky Way. It
remains unclear, however, whether cannibalized substructures are as
common in the haloes of galaxies as predicted by galaxy-formation
theory. Here we report the discovery of a giant stream of metal-rich
stars within the halo of the nearest large galaxy, M31 (the Andromeda
galaxy). The source of this stream could be the dwarf galaxies M32 and
NGC205, which are close companions of M31 and which may have lost a
substantial number of stars owing to tidal interactions. The results
demonstrate that the epoch of galaxy building still continues, albeit at
a modest rate, and that tidal streams may be a generic feature of galaxy
haloes.

	Abstract = {{The third US Naval Observatory (USNO) CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC3, was
released at the IAU General Assembly on 2009 August 10. It is the first
all-sky release in this series and contains just over 100 million
objects, about 95 million of them with proper motions, covering about R
= 8-16 mag. Current epoch positions are obtained from the observations
with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's ''red lens,'' equipped with a 4k
{\times} 4k CCD. Proper motions are derived by combining these
observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs, including
Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of
over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars in
the southern hemisphere, the Yale/San Juan first epoch plates from the
Southern Proper Motion (SPM) program (YSJ1) form the basis for proper
motions. These data are supplemented by all-sky Schmidt plate survey
astrometry and photometry obtained from the SuperCOSMOS project, as well
as 2MASS near-IR photometry. Major differences of UCAC3 data as compared
with UCAC2 include a completely new raw data reduction with improved
control over systematic errors in positions, significantly improved
photometry, slightly deeper limiting magnitude, coverage of the north
pole region, greater completeness by inclusion of double stars, and weak
detections. This of course leads to a catalog which is not as ''clean'' as
UCAC2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper. The
positional accuracy of stars in UCAC3 is about 15-100 mas per
coordinate, depending on magnitude, while the errors in proper motions
range from 1 to 10 mas yr$^{-1}$ depending on magnitude and
observing history, with a significant improvement over UCAC2 achieved
due to the re-reduced SPM data and inclusion of more astrograph plate
data unavailable at the time of UCAC2.

	Abstract = {{We present a new method for constraining the Milky Way's gravitational
potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. This method
requires full six-dimensional phase-space information for all stars in
the streams, which will be provided by Gaia, but it does not require
specific identification of any stream in the data, nor determination of
stream membership for any star, nor any physical model of stream
formation or morphology. The method works on the principle that the
action distribution of stars is most clustered (most informative or
least entropic) when the potential used to calculate the actions is
closest to the true potential. To measure the amount of clustering we
use the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) or cross-entropy or relative
entropy, a measure of information. The KLD has an interpretation as a
relative likelihood, so the method can make use of the machinery of
probabilistic inference, including especially providing justified
uncertainties on parameter estimates. We show for toy Gaia-like data (in
a spherical isochrone potential) that maximization of the KLD of the
action-space distribution of stars relative to a smoother distribution
(product of marginals) can be used to estimate accurately the true
values of the potential parameters, with a precision depending on the
observational errors and the number and type of streams in the sample.

	Abstract = {{We investigate how the shapes and angular momenta of galaxy and group
mass dark matter halos in a {$\Lambda$}CDM N-body simulation are correlated
internally and how they are aligned with respect to the location and
properties of surrounding halos. We explore these relationships down to
halos of much lower mass (10$^{11}$ h$^{-1}$
M$_{solar}$) than previous studies. The halos are triaxial, with
c/a ratios of 0.6+/-0.1 and a mean two-dimensional projected ellipticity
of =0.24. More massive halos are more flattened. The axis ratios rise
out to 0.6r$_{vir}$, beyond which they drop. The principal axes,
in particular the minor axes, are very well aligned within 0.6
r$_{vir}$. High-mass halos show particularly strong internal
alignment. The angular momentum vectors are also reasonably well aligned
except between the very outermost and very innermost regions of the
halo. The angular momentum vectors tend to align with the minor axes,
with a mean misalignment of \~{}25{\deg}, and lie perpendicular to the major
and intermediate axes. The properties of a halo at 0.4 r$_{vir}$
are quite characteristic of the properties at most other radii within
the halo. There is a very strong tendency for the minor axes of halos to
lie perpendicular to large-scale filaments, and a much weaker tendency
for the major axes to lie along the filaments. This alignment extends to
much larger separations for group and cluster mass halos than for galaxy
mass halos. As a consequence, the intrinsic alignments of galaxies are
likely weaker than previous predictions, which were based on the shapes
of cluster mass halos. The angular momenta of the highest concentration
halos tend to point toward other halos. The angular momenta of galaxy
mass halos point parallel to filaments, while those of group and cluster
mass halos show a very strong tendency to point perpendicular to the
filaments. This suggests that group and cluster mass halos acquire most
of their angular momentum from major mergers along filaments, while the
accretion history of mass and angular momentum onto galaxy mass halos
has been smoother.

	Abstract = {{Although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its
applicability on cosmological length scales has yet to be stringently
tested. Such a test has recently been proposed, using a quantity,
E$_{G}$, that combines measures of large-scale gravitational
lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate. The combination is
insensitive to `galaxy bias' (the difference between the clustering of
visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust to the
uncertainty in this parameter. Modified theories of gravity generally
predict values of E$_{G}$ different from the general relativistic
prediction because, in these theories, the `gravitational slip' (the
difference between the two potentials that describe perturbations in the
gravitational metric) is non-zero, which leads to changes in the growth
of structure and the strength of the gravitational lensing effect. Here
we report that E$_{G}$ = 0.39+/-0.06 on length scales of tens of
megaparsecs, in agreement with the general relativistic prediction of
E$_{G}$\~{}0.4. The measured value excludes a model within the
tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies both Newtonian and
Einstein gravity. However, the relatively large uncertainty still
permits models within f() theory, which is an extension of general
relativity. A fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out
these models.

those hosting Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to haloes
corresponding to the richest galaxy clusters. The `Milky Way' haloes of
the Aquarius Project were selected from a lower resolution version of

result, they are present in the MS-II along with thousands of other

	Abstract = {{We present a family of robust tracer mass estimators to compute the
enclosed mass of galaxy haloes from samples of discrete positional and
kinematical data of tracers, such as halo stars, globular clusters and
dwarf satellites. The data may be projected positions, distances,
line-of-sight velocities or proper motions. The estimators all assume
that the tracer population has a scale-free density and moves in a
scale-free potential in the region of interest. The circumstances under
which the boundary terms can be discarded and the estimator converges
are derived. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way Galaxy
and for M31 are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the
uncertainty as a function of sample size.

For the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite sample consists of 26 galaxies
with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way
within 300 kpc is M$_{300}$ = 0.9 +/- 0.3 {\times}
10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$ assuming velocity isotropy. However,
the mass estimate is sensitive to the assumed anisotropy and could
plausibly lie between 0.7 {\times} 10$^{12}$ and 3.4 {\times}
10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$, if anisotropies implied by simulations
or by the observations are used. Incorporating the proper motions of six
Milky Way satellites into the data set, we find M$_{300}$ = 1.4
+/- 0.3 {\times} 10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$. The range here if
plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 {\times}
10$^{12}$ to 2.7 {\times} 10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$. Note
that our error bars only incorporate the statistical uncertainty. There
are much greater uncertainties induced by velocity anisotropy and by
selection of satellite members.

For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with measured line-of-sight
velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions. We use the
line-of-sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to
estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as M$_{300}$ = 1.4 +/- 0.4
{\times} 10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$ assuming isotropy. There is
only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass varying between
1.3 {\times} 10$^{12}$ and 1.6 {\times}
10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$. Incorporating the proper motion data
set does not change the results significantly. Given the uncertainties,
we conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable
insights into which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive.

Leo I has long been known to dominate mass estimates for the Milky Way
due to its substantial distance and line-of-sight velocity. We find that
And XII and And XIV similarly dominate the estimated mass of M31. As
such, we repeat the calculations without these galaxies, in case they
are not bound - although on the balance of the evidence, we favour their
inclusion in mass calculations.

halo, based on 2401 rigorously selected blue horizontal-branch halo
stars from SDSS DR6. This sample enables construction of the full
line-of-sight velocity distribution at different galactocentric radii.
To interpret these distributions, we compare them to matched mock
observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation
simulations designed to resemble the Milky Way. This procedure results
in an estimate of the Milky Way's circular velocity curve to \~{}60 kpc,
which is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of 220 km
s$^{-1}$ at the Sun's location, and implies M({\lt}60
kpc)=(4.0+/-0.7){\times}10$^{11}$ M$_{solar}$. The radial
dependence of V$_{cir}$(r), derived in statistically independent
bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations from an NFW dark
matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center.
If we assume that an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration
holds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the
Milky Way's dark matter halo,
M$_{vir}$=1.0$^{+0.3}$$_{-0.2}${\times}10$^{12}$
M$_{solar}$, which is lower than many previous estimates. We have
checked that the particulars of the cosmological simulations are
unlikely to introduce systematics larger than the statistical
uncertainties. This estimate implies that nearly 40\% of the baryons
within the virial radius of the Milky Way's dark matter halo reside in
the stellar components of our Galaxy. A value for M$_{vir}$ of
only \~{}1{\times}10$^{12}$ M$_{solar}$ also (re)opens the
question of whether all of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies are on
bound orbits.

	Abstract = {{A simple model for the Milky Way halo is presented. It has a flat
rotation curve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply
beyond an outer edge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model
possesses a rich family of simple distribution functions which vary in
velocity anisotropy. The model is used to estimate the total mass of the
Milky Way halo using the latest data on the motions of satellite
galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii greater than
20kpc. This comprises a data set of 27 objects with known distances and
radial velocities, of which six also possess measured proper motions.
Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum
likelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I,
provided both radial and proper motion data are used. The availability
of the proper motion data for the satellites is crucial as, without
them, the mass estimates with and without Leo I are inconsistent at the
99per cent confidence level. All these results are derived from models
in which the velocity normalization of the halo potential is taken as
\~{}220kms$^{-1}$. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our
estimate is presented, including the effects of the small data set,
possible incompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample
and the measurement errors. The most serious uncertainties come from the
size of the data set, which may cause a systematic underestimate by a
factor of 2, and the measurement errors, which cause a scatter in the
mass of the order of a factor of 2. We conclude that the total mass of
the halo is \~{}1.9-1.7+3.6x10$^{12}$M$_{solar}$, while the
mass within 50kpc is \~{}5.4-3.6+0.2x10$^{11}$M$_{solar}$. In
the near future, ground-based radial velocity surveys of samples of blue
horizontal branch (BHB) stars are a valuable way to augment the sparse
data set. A data set of \~{}200 radial velocities of BHB stars will reduce
the uncertainty in the mass estimate to \~{}20per cent. In the coming
decade, microarcsecond astrometry will be possible with the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM) and the Global Astrometry Interferometer
for Astrophysics (GAIA) satellites. For example, GAIA can provide the
proper motions of the distant dwarfs like Leo I to within
+/-15kms$^{-1}$ and the nearer dwarfs like Ursa Minor to within
+/-1kms$^{-1}$. This will also allow the total mass of the Milky
Way to be found to \~{}20per cent. SIM and GAIA will also provide an
accurate estimate of the velocity normalization of the halo potential at
large radii.

30{\deg}). Our results are in good agreement with the extinction
normalization given by the Schlegel et al. (SFD) dust maps at high
northern Galactic latitudes, but indicate that the SFD extinction map
appears to be consistently overestimated by about 20\% in the southern
sky, in agreement with recent study by Schlafly et al. The constraints
on the shape of the dust extinction curve across the SDSS and 2MASS
bandpasses disfavor the reddening law of O'Donnell, but support the
models by Fitzpatrick and Cardelli et al. For the latter, we find a
ratio of the total to selective absorption to be R$_{V}$ = 3.0
{\plusmn} 0.1(random){\plusmn}0.1 (systematic) over most of the
high-latitude sky. At low Galactic latitudes (|b| {\lt} 5{\deg}), we
demonstrate that the SFD map cannot be reliably used to correct for
extinction because most stars are embedded in dust, rather than behind
it, as is the case at high Galactic latitudes. We analyze
three-dimensional maps of the best-fit R$_{V}$ and find that
R$_{V}$ = 3.1 cannot be ruled out in any of the 10 SEGUE stripes
at a precision level of \~{}0.1-0.2. Our best estimate for the intrinsic
scatter of R$_{V}$ in the regions probed by SEGUE stripes is \~{}0.2.
We introduce a method for efficient selection of candidate red giant
stars in the disk, dubbed ''dusty parallax relation,'' which utilizes a
correlation between distance and the extinction along the line of sight.
We make these best-fit parameters, as well as all the input SDSS and
2MASS data, publicly available in a user-friendly format. These data can
be used for studies of stellar number density distribution, the
distribution of dust properties, for selecting sources whose SED differs
from SEDs for high-latitude main-sequence stars, and for estimating
distances to dust clouds and, in turn, to molecular gas clouds.

unprecedented constraints on the stellar and dark matter mass

independently fit a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral,
action-based distribution function (DF) to the phase-space data of 43
separate abundance-selected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the
complex selection effects affecting the data. We robustly measure the

@article{LawMajewski2010,
	Abstract = {{We present a new N-body model for the tidal disruption of the
Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf that is capable of simultaneously satisfying the
majority of angular position, distance, and radial velocity constraints
imposed by current wide-field surveys of its dynamically young (lsim3
Gyr) tidal debris streams. In particular, this model resolves the
conflicting angular position and radial velocity constraints on the Sgr
leading tidal stream that have been highlighted in recent years. While
the model does not reproduce the apparent bifurcation observed in the
leading debris stream, recent observational data suggest that this
bifurcation may represent a constraint on the internal properties of the
Sgr dwarf rather than the details of its orbit. The key element in the
success of this model is the introduction of a non-axisymmetric
component to the Galactic gravitational potential that can be described
in terms of a triaxial dark matter halo whose minor/major axis ratio
(c/a)$_{Phi}$ = 0.72 and intermediate/major axis ratio
(b/a)$_{Phi}$ = 0.99 at radii 20 kpc {\lt} r {\lt} 60 kpc. The
minor/intermediate/major axes of this halo lie along the directions (l,
b) = (7{\deg}, 0{\deg}), (0{\deg}, 90{\deg}), and (97{\deg}, 0{\deg})
respectively, corresponding to a nearly oblate ellipsoid whose minor
axis is contained within the Galactic disk plane. This particular
disk/halo orientation is difficult to reconcile within the general
context of galactic dynamics (and cold dark matter models in
particular), suggesting either that the orientation may have evolved
significantly with time or that inclusion of other non-axisymmetric
components (such as the gravitational influence of the Magellanic
Clouds) in the model may obviate the need for triaxiality in the dark
matter halo. The apparent proper motion of Sgr in this model is
estimated to be ({$\mu$}$_{ l }$cos b, {$\mu$}$_{ b }$) = (-2.16,
1.73) mas yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a Galactocentric space
velocity (U, V, W) = (230, -35, 195) km s$^{-1}$ . Based on the
velocity dispersion in the stellar tidal streams, we estimate that Sgr
has a current bound mass M $_{Sgr}$ = 2.5$^{+1.3}$
$_{-1.0}$ {\times} 10$^{8}$ M $_{sun}$. We demonstrate
that with simple assumptions about the star formation history of Sgr,
tidal stripping models naturally give rise to gradients in the
metallicity distribution function (MDF) along the stellar debris streams
similar to those observed in recent studies. These models predict a
strong evolution in the MDF of the model Sgr dwarf with time, indicating
that the chemical abundances of stars in Sgr at the present day may be
significantly different than the abundances of those already contributed
to the Galactic stellar halo. We conclude by using the new N-body model
to re-evaluate previous claims of the association of miscellaneous halo
substructure with the Sgr dwarf.

	Abstract = {{Eighteen RR Lyrae variables (RRLs) that lie in the ``12.4h clump''
identified by the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) have been
observed spectroscopically to measure their radial velocities and metal
abundances. Ten blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars identified by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) were added to this sample. Six of the
nine stars in the densest region of the clump have a mean radial
velocity in the Galactic rest frame (V$_{gsr}$) of 99.8 and
{$\sigma$}=17.3 km s$^{-1}$, which is slightly smaller than the
average error of the measurements. The whole sample contains eight RRLs
and five BHB stars that have values of V$_{gsr}$ suggesting
membership in this stream. For seven of these RRLs, the measurements of
[Fe/H], which have an internal precision of 0.08 dex, yield
{\lt}[Fe/H]{\gt}=-1.86 and {$\sigma$}=0.40. These values suggest that the
stream is a tidally disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy of low luminosity.
Photometry from the database of the SDSS indicates that this stream
covers at least 106 deg$^{2}$ of the sky in the constellation
Virgo. The name Virgo stellar stream is suggested.

hemisphere is analyzed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8.
Parallel to the Sagittarius tidal track, but \~{}10{\deg} away, there is
another fainter and more metal-poor stream. We provide evidence that the
two streams follow similar distance gradients but have distinct
morphological properties and stellar populations. The brighter stream is
broader, contains more metal-rich stars, and has a richer
color-magnitude diagram with multiple turnoffs and a prominent red clump
as compared to the fainter stream. Based on the structural properties
and the stellar population mix, the stream configuration is similar to
the Northern ''bifurcation.'' In the region of the South Galactic Cap,
there is overlapping tidal debris from the Cetus stream, which crosses
the Sagittarius stream. Using both photometric and spectroscopic data,
we show that the blue straggler population belongs mainly to Sagittarius
and the blue horizontal branch stars belong mainly to the Cetus stream

	Abstract = {{Building on the legacy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-I and II),
SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific
themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and
structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around
other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide
regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data
Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes
SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest
pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations.
This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise
SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure
redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Ly{$\alpha$} forest spectra
of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of
large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the
distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z {\lt} 0.7 and at z {\ap}
2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the
continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R =
{$\lambda$}/{$\Delta$}{$\lambda$} {\ap} 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in
a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar
kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter
halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the
Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain
high-resolution (R {\ap} 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N {\gt}=
100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 {$\mu$}m {\lt} {$\lambda$} {\lt} 1.70
{$\mu$}m) spectra of 10$^{5}$ evolved, late-type stars, measuring
separate abundances for \~{}15 elements per star and creating the first
high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations
(bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and
spectral diagnostics. The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet
Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor radial velocities of more than
8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s$^{-1}$,
\~{}24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to
two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the
formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011
January, SDSS-III has obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies,
29,000 z {\gt}= 2.2 quasars, and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity
measurements of 2580 stars for MARVELS.

	Abstract = {{We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in
the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from
simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated
individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging
from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The
spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted
over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ''universal'' profile. The
characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its
concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects
the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are
approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are
significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than
r$^{-2}$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation
curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase
systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of
bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have
circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed.
This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in
observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For
galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence
of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster
medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate
estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results
also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too
concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for
dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger
than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply
that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy
formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed
to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.

209.60d+/-0.18d, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects
of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this
motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the

likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within

supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our
observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative

``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than \~{}10$^{4}$

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data, four of which were followed up
with either the Subaru or the Isaac Newton Telescopes. They include four
probable new dwarf galaxies-one each in the constellations of Coma
Berenices, Canes Venatici, Leo, and Hercules-together with one unusually
extended globular cluster, Segue 1. We provide distances, absolute
magnitudes, half-light radii, and color-magnitude diagrams for all five
satellites. The morphological features of the color-magnitude diagrams
are generally well described by the ridge line of the old, metal-poor
globular cluster M92. In the past two years, a total of 10 new Milky Way
satellites with effective surface brightness {$\mu$}$_{v}${\gt}\~{}28 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ have been discovered in SDSS data. They are less
luminous, more irregular, and apparently more metal-poor than the
previously known nine Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. The relationship
between these objects and other populations is discussed. We note that
there is a paucity of objects with half-light radii between \~{}40 and \~{}100

up from a predominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to
the globular clusters M13 and M92. The integrated absolute magnitude of
the stream stars is estimated to be M$_{r}$\~{}-7.5. There is
tentative evidence for a velocity signature, with the stream moving at

at high declinations. The stream lies on the same great circle as
Complex A, a roughly linear association of H I high-velocity clouds

three, roughly parallel components in a 65{\deg}-long, stellar stream
complex previously identified with the Monoceros Ring. The three-stream
complex varies in width from 4{\deg} to 6{\deg} along its length and
appears to be made up of two or more narrow substreams as well as a
broader, diffuse component. The width and complexity of the stream
indicate that the progenitor was likely a dwarf galaxy of significant
size and mass. The stream is 8.9 kpc distant and is oriented almost
perpendicularly to our line of sight. The visible portion of the stream
does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies, and a preliminary orbit
does not point to any viable progenitor candidates. Orbits for the
narrower substreams can be modeled with velocity offsets from the broad
component of \~{}8 km s$^{-1}$. We suggest that the broad component
is likely to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy, while the narrower
streams constitute the remnants of dynamically distinct components that
may have included a native population of globular clusters. While the
color of the main-sequence turnoff is not unlike that for the Monoceros
Ring, neither the visible stream nor any reasonable projection of its
orbit passes through Monoceros or Canis Major, and we conclude that this
stream is probably unrelated to the overdensities found in these

streams and substructures, finding that the stream cannot be identified
with known structures: it is a new, nearby substructure in the Galaxy's

we account for the localization of the stream. We find that the stream
is dynamically young and therefore likely the debris of a recently
disrupted dwarf galaxy or globular cluster. The Aquarius stream is thus
a specimen of ongoing hierarchical Galaxy formation, rare for being

tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters. The
fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53{\deg}

each of the streams spans multiple constellations, we extend tradition
and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the
same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a \~{}1 kpc
wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color-magnitude
distribution, which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface
density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed
morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and
in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current

survived for many orbits about the Galaxy. Extant numerical calculations
modeled this galaxy as a system with a centrally-concentrated mass
profile, following the light, and found that it should lose more than
one-half of its mass every 2-4 orbits and be completely disrupted long
before now. Apparently $\backslash$sgr, and by implication other dSph galaxies, do
not have a centrally-concentrated profile for their dark matter. We
develop a model in which the stars of the Sgr dwarf are embedded in a
constant-density dark matter halo, representing the core of a
tidally-limited system, and show that this is consistent with its
survival. We present new photometric and kinematic observations of $\backslash$sgr$\backslash$
and show these data are consistent with this explanation for the
continued existence of this galaxy. $\backslash$Sgg$\backslash$ is being tidally distorted and
is tidally limited, but is not disrupted as yet. The corresponding
minimum total mass is 10(9) msun , while the central mass to visual
light ratio \~{} 50 in Solar units. Our new photographic photometry allows
the detection of main-sequence stars of $\backslash$sgg$\backslash$ over an area of 22deg x
8deg . $\backslash$Sgg$\backslash$ is prolate, with axis ratios \~{} 3:1:1. For an adopted
distance of 16 +/- 2 kpc from the Galactic center on the opposite side
of the Galaxy to the Sun, the major axis is gta 9 kpc long and is
aligned approximately normal to the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy,
roughly following the coordinate line l=5(deg) . The central velocity
dispersion of giant stars which are members of $\backslash$sgg$\backslash$ is 11.4 +/- 0.7 kms
and is consistent with being constant over the face of the galaxy. The
gradient in mean line-of-sight velocity with position along the major
axis, dv/db, is \~{} 0 kms /degree in the central regions and increases in
amplitude to dv/db=-3 kms /degree over the outermost three degrees for
which we have data. A first measurement of the proper motion of Sgr
determines the component of its space velocity parallel to its major
axis to be 250 +/- 90 kms , directed towards the Galactic Plane. We
model these kinematic data to determine the orbit of $\backslash$sgg. Our best fit
model has an orbital period of lta 1 Gyr and has $\backslash$sgr close to
perigalacticon. This period is shorter, by about a factor of \~{} gt 10,
than the age of the bulk of its stellar population.

is consistent with a closed-box model and multiple (4-5) star formation
bursts over the entire life of the satellite, including the time since
Sgr began disrupting.

	Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies undergoing several
close encounters with the Milky Way are described. By comparing our
models to observed properties of the recently discovered dwarf galaxy in
Sagittarius (Sgr), we discuss implications of our results for the
formation and evolution of the Milky Way system. We find that existing
observations are not sufficient to allow us to place precise limits on
either the orbit or the initial state of the dwarf. Debris from the
ongoing tidal stripping of the Sagittarius galaxy are expected to form
moving groups in the halo of the Galaxy, and the discovery of such stars
would strongly constrain the history and dynamical state of the dwarf
Furthermore, if Sgr is presently being disrupted, we predict that its
remains will be detectable as a moving group in the halo for more than 1
Gyr. Thus, if similar accretion events have occurred in the recent
history of the Galaxy, their after effects may still be observable.

@article{Majewski2003,
	Abstract = {{We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy
mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS). Near-infrared photometry of Sgr's prominent M-giant
population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of Sgr.
The main body is fitted with a King profile of limiting major-axis
radius 30{\deg}-substantially larger than previously found or
assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from
stars in the Sgr tidal tails; thus the Sgr radial profile resembles that
of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting traditional
methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the brightness
of the main body of Sgr to be M$_{V}$=-13.27 (the brightest of the
known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to
be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with
suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the
King-fit core radius (224') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius
as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic
disruption during its last orbits. The M-giant distribution of Sgr
exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to,
the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54. A striking trailing
tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc across the
south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean
distance varying from \~{}20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading debris arm
extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an
apogalacticon \~{}45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the north
Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the Galactic
plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes, covers the
NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital
plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies within a kiloparsec of
that plane and near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, it is possible
that former Sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood. We discuss
the implications of this new view of the Sgr galaxy and its entrails for
the character of the Sgr orbit, mass, mass-loss rate, and contribution
of stars to the Milky Way halo. The minimal precession displayed by the
Sgr tidal debris along its inclined orbit supports the notion of a
nearly spherical Galactic potential. The number of M giants in the Sgr
tails is at least 15\% that contained within the King limiting radius of
the main Sgr body. The fact that M giants, presumably formed within the
past few gigayears in the Sgr nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread
along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of
these arms but also poses a timing problem that bears on the recent
binding energy of the Sgr core and that is most naturally explained by
recent and catastrophic mass loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than
75\% of the high-latitude, halo M giants, despite substantial reservoirs
of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant
tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good
correspondence is found between the M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr
system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris,
with the exception of Sgr carbon stars, which must be subluminous
compared with counterparts in other Galactic satellites in order to
resolve the discrepancy.

	Abstract = {{We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation
of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an angle of \~{}10
deg on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is comparable in size
and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, Fornax. The new galaxy
has many features in common with the other eight Galactic dwarf
spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density spatial structure,
a well-populated red horizontal branch with a blue extension, and a
substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar populations it
most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong
intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread.
Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only \~{}16 kpc
from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly
elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and
suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the
Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of
140 km s\^{}-1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very
few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently
undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the
Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54,
Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination
of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate
measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre
spectrograph, AUTOFIB.

@article{Dinescu1999,
	Abstract = {{We have compiled a catalog of absolute proper motions of globular
clusters from various sources. The sample consists of 38 clusters, from
which most of the southern ones (15 clusters) were measured in our
previous papers in this series. We have integrated orbits assuming two
different Galactic potential models adopted from the literature and have
calculated orbital parameters. The uncertainties associated with the
orbital parameters were derived in a Monte Carlo approach, and we
conclude that, overall, at the present level of measurement errors,
orbital differences due to Galactic potential models are not
significant. Three metal-poor clusters are found to have orbits similar
to prototypical metal-rich disk clusters. These clusters are NGC 6254
(M10), NGC 6626 (M28), and NGC 6752. We interpret this as a potentially
significant constraint on the formation of the disk. It is thus possible
that part of the inner metal-poor halo is the low-metallicity tail of
the thick disk. In this case, the ages of these clusters indicate that
the formation of the disk partially overlapped with that of the halo.
The clusters classified as ``young halo'' or ``red horizontal-branch''
by Zinn show a radially anisotropic velocity distribution, their orbits
are of high total energy, with apocentric radii larger than 10 kpc and
highly eccentric. In this sense they may represent an accreted component
of our Galaxy. We also discuss omega Cen's orbit characteristics in the
view of an accreted origin. We investigate the effect of the orbital
motion on the internal dynamics of clusters. Adopting the formalism from
Gnedin {\amp} Ostriker and their destruction rates due to two-body
relaxation, we find that, in most cases, this internal process is more
important than the destruction processes due to disk and bulge shocking.
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations argue that NGC 6397's
luminosity function is depleted at the faint end, and this is blamed on
its high total destruction rate. We propose a list of clusters with
similar destruction rates that may also have depleted luminosity
functions. We also note the bias toward deriving higher destruction
rates in studies that statistically assign tangential velocities based
on a kinematic model of the globular cluster system, in contrast to the
rates derived from the measured tangential velocities. Clusters prone to
such biases are those that have circular orbits (kinematically
thick-disk clusters) and some of those with orbits of high total energy.

	Abstract = {{The latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey data reveal a prominent bifurcation
in the distribution of debris of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr)
beginning at a right ascension of {$\alpha$}\~{}190$^{deg}$. Two
branches of the stream (A and B) persist at roughly the same
heliocentric distance over at least 50{\deg} of arc. There is also
evidence for a more distant structure (C) well behind the A branch. This
paper provides the first explanation for the bifurcation. It is caused
by the projection of the young leading (A) and old trailing (B) tidal
arms of the Sgr, while the old leading arm (C) lies well behind A. This
explanation is only possible if the halo is close to spherical, as the
angular difference between the branches is a measure of the precession
of the orbital plane.

	Abstract = {{We present evidence for a new Milky Way stellar tidal stream in the
direction of the Andromeda and Triangulum (M31 and M33) galaxies. Using
a matched-filter technique, we search the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 8 by creating stellar density maps which probe the Milky Way
halo at distances between 8 and 40 kpc. A visual search of these maps
recovers all of the major known stellar streams, as well as a new stream
in the direction of M31/M33 that we name the Triangulum stream. The
stream spans 0fdg2 by 12{\deg} on the sky, or 75 pc by 5.5 kpc in
physical units with a best-fitting distance of 26 {\plusmn} 4 kpc. The
width of the stream is consistent with being the tidal remnant of a
globular cluster. A color-magnitude diagram of the stream region shows
an overdensity which, if identified as a main-sequence turnoff,
corresponds to an old (\~{}12 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H] \~{}-1.0 dex)
stellar population. Future kinematic studies of this and similar cold
streams will provide tight constraints on the shape of the Galactic
gravitational potential.
