streamgap-aa
=============

Modeling stream gaps in action-angle coordinates.

This repository contains the code associated with the paper Sanders, Bovy \& Erkal (2015, SBE15). The paper source code is in [paper/](tree/master/paper/) and ipython notebooks used to generate the plots in the paper can be found in [py/](tree/master/py/).

There are three useful notebooks:

----------------------
This notebook is split into 3 sections.

1. We test the analytic computation of the velocity kicks for both Plummer and Hernquist profiles.
2. We generate Fig. 2 of Sanders, Bovy & Erkal (2015, SBE15) which compares the kicks from different subhalo profiles.
3. We generate Fig. 1 of SBE15 which computes the kicks for a curved stream track with increasing levels of complexity
